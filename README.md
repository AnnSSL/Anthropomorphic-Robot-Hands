# OpenBionics - Anthropomorphic Robot Hands

Anthropomorphic, adaptive robot hand with bio-inspired fingers. The bio-inspired fingers employ a metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint that can achieve both flexion/extension and adduction/abduction concurrently, using two actuators. The two actuators offer increased power
transmission during the execution of precise grasping and dexterous, in-hand manipulation tasks. Moreover, a design optimization
framework utilizes results of hand anthropometry studies to derive key parameters of the bio-inspired actuation design.

## Contents

In this repository you can find:
* CAD files of the bio-inspired finger 
* ROS package software for dual actuators operation
* Design optimization framework
