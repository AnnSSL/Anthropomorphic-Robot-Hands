# OpenBionics - Anthropomorphic Robot Hands

Anthropomorphic, adaptive robot hand with bio-inspired fingers. The compliant fingers employ a metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint design that can perform flexion/extension and adduction/abduction concurrently.

## Contents

In this repository you can find:
* CAD files of the bio-inspired finger equipped with the MCP joint design
* ROS package software for dual operation of Dynamixel RX-28 servo motors 
* Design optimization framework for differential mechanism parameters
* Archive of prototype images

## Notes
